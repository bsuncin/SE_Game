--Intro to the game--
  Narrator: Once upon a time in a land not quite far away but really somewhat not incredibly close, so pretty much in 
            an indiclosed area in the middle of far and close there was a great evil that fell on the kingdom of Antisoc.
          : Antisoc was once a kingdom where memes were plentiful and chicken tendies abundant, but it has now fallen 
            into the darkness that is crappy reposts and Kale Salads.
          : This evil darkness was brought upon the land by one reason the disappearance of the Queen "Queen Slay" whose 
            husband, The King, threw off the balance of the land with his sorrow.
          : Many have tried and many have failed, only the Mightest adventurer can help save the Queen and bring balance 
            back to the kingdom.

              outside the castle and was taken to THE CAGE!! at the top floor of the DUNGEON OF optional DOOOOMM!!!!
