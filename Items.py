# Items will work as a pseudo database where all items for the game
# will reside. If an item isn't in this file it won't exist in the game.
# Items in the items dictionary will be formatted as follows:
# key = item name
# value = tuple of values for the key
# key : (Value, Physical Attack, Physical Defence, Magic Attack, Magic Defence,
# Type, Health Recovery, Mana Recovery, Added health, Added Mana) 

items = { "HP Potion": (200, 0, 0, 0, 0, "potion", 50, 0, 0, 0)
